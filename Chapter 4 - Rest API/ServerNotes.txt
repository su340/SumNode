Special requirements to create a server using Js:

  To create a server using JavaScript, specifically in the Node.js runtime environment, you need to follow these general steps:

        1. Set up Node.js: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).

        2. Initialize a new project: Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the command line. Run `npm init` to initialize a new Node.js project. This will create a `package.json` file that holds metadata about your project and its dependencies.

        3. Install necessary dependencies: You may need to install additional packages or modules depending on your server requirements. For example, to create a basic HTTP server, you can use the built-in `http` module. If you want to build more complex servers, you might consider using frameworks like Express.js or Koa.js. Use the `npm install` command to install the required dependencies.

        4. Create the server file: Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `server.js`) where you will define and configure your server.

        5. Write server code: In your server file, you can require the necessary modules, define routes and endpoints, and set up any middleware or additional functionality you need. You will typically use the `http` module or a web framework to handle incoming requests and send responses.

        6. Start the server: At the end of your server file, start the server by calling the appropriate function or method. For example, if you are using the `http` module, you can use `http.createServer()` to create the server instance and then call `server.listen(port)` to start listening on a specific port.

        7. Run the server: Use the command line to navigate to the project directory and run the server file using the Node.js command. For example, `node server.js`. This will start the server and make it accessible at the specified port.

        8. Test the server: Open a web browser or a tool like cURL or Postman and make requests to your server to test its functionality.

    These are the general steps to create a server using JavaScript in the Node.js environment. The specifics may vary depending on the libraries or frameworks you choose to work with and the requirements of your server application.


*Syntax to create a server:

      const http = require('http');

           // Create the server
      const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
          // Handle incoming requests
          // Example: Send "Hello, World!" as the response
      response.statusCode = 200;
      response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
      response.end('Hello, World!');
      });

          // Start the server
      const port = 3000; // Specify the desired port number
      server.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
      });


*what is difference between start and dev

    In the context of a package.json file, "start" and "dev" are commonly used script names. Here's the difference between them:

      "start":
          The "start" script is a convention used to define the command that should be executed when your application starts in a production environment. It is typically used when deploying your application to a production server. For example, you might use "node server.js" as the value for the "start" script if your application is started using the "node" command.
          To run the "start" script, you would use the following command:
                => npm start
      "dev":
          The "dev" script is often used during the development phase of your application. It defines the command that should be executed when you want to run your application in a development environment. This script can be used to set up a development server, enable features like live reloading or automatic restarts, or perform other development-specific tasks.
          To run the "dev" script, you would use a command similar to this:

                =>npm run dev
      The main difference between "start" and "dev" is the intended usage and context.
      "start" is typically used for production environments, 
      while "dev" is used for development environments. 
      The commands executed in these scripts can vary
      based on the specific needs of your application and the tools you are using.


*Express and nodemon are two separate tools that are commonly used together in Node.js 

    Express:
      Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js. 
      It simplifies the process of building web applications by 
      providing a robust set of features and utilities. Express helps with routing, middleware management, handling HTTP requests and responses, and more. It allows you to create server-side applications and APIs with ease.

    Nodemon:
      Nodemon is a utility that helps in the development process by automatically restarting the Node.js 
      application whenever changes are detected in the source code.
      It eliminates the need to manually stop and restart the server after each code modification. Nodemon is not specific to any particular framework and can be used with any Node.js application.

    The connection between Express and nodemon is straightforward:

During development, you can use nodemon to monitor your Express application's source code for changes.
Whenever you make changes and save the files, nodemon will automatically restart the Express server,
allowing you to immediately see the changes without manually restarting the server.

---Express application

          The code snippet you provided creates an Express server and starts it listening on port 8080. Here's a breakdown of the code:
                  const server = express();
          This line creates an instance of the Express application by calling the `express()` function. The `server` variable represents the Express application, which can be used to define routes, middleware, and handle HTTP requests.
                  server.listen(8080);

          This line starts the Express server and makes it listen for incoming requests on port 8080. The `listen()` method is provided by the `server` object, which is an instance of the Express application. The argument `8080` specifies the port number on which the server will listen for incoming requests.
          Once the server is started, it will continue to listen for requests until it is explicitly stopped or the application process is terminated.

  Here's an example of a complete Express server setup:

            const express = require('express');
            const server = express();

// Define routes and middleware here
            const port = 8080;
            server.listen(port, () => {
              console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
            });


  In this example, you can add routes and middleware before calling `server.listen()`.
  This allows you to define the behavior and handle various HTTP requests based on the routes you specify.
  With the server running and listening on port 8080, 
  you can access your Express application by visiting `http://localhost:8080` 
  in your web browser or making requests to that address programmatically.

STEPS:
  *npm init
  *npm install express
  * //once the server is started it doesn't stop automatically,
      it keeps running

    *devDependencies: download and to run write it down under "script" under "package.json"

  *npm outdates: to check the files if any outdated with the project

  *To uninstall any module(eg:express)

         ==>npm uninstall express

      (defualt packgae with the default name and the rest will be installed)

  *const http = require('http');
    =>The code snippet you provided is importing the http module in a Node.js environment. The http module is a core module in Node.js that 
      allows you to create HTTP servers or make HTTP requests.
    =>http.createServer((req,res)=>{}): call back function 
  
Request:
  server(server is like a function which run once the request is made) = (create+listen+run)
      =>how to see it is running
        run=> localhost:portNumber(only request is made, still response is not created)

Response:

  main method of response is "end"

*Headers can be set for request and response using setHeaders() method
    req.setHeader()
    res.setHeader()

*paasing JSON data to the server

  ^JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data 
     interchange format that is commonly used for transmitting
     data between a server and a web application, or between different parts of an application. It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
  ^JSON data is represented as a collection of key-value pairs. The keys are strings enclosed in double quotation marks,
     and the values can be various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or nested JSON objects.
eg: JSON data
  {
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "hobbies": ["reading", "traveling", "cooking"],
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "New York",
    "country": "USA"
  }
}

*node is not smart enough to understand by intself to idenftify JSON data, 
it has to be changes into the string 

`=> using JSON.stringify
but still node has to be specified that data send is JSON

=> using contnt-type header to tag it as JSON data
tagging or sending as a JSON data-type

    *res.setHeader('Content-Type','application/json');


//Now lets seee Request:

  let us create a dummy JSON file from internet
  and one HTML file.

*to read/send the file (JSON,HMTL) using ".readFile" or ".readFileSync"

  ---we re using .readFileSync outside the server, as it will run once only when the server starts
