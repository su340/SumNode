-------------MiddleWare

*Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
    *Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
      ^Execute any code.
      ^Make changes to the request and the response objects.
      ^End the request-response cycle.
      ^Call the next middleware in the stack.
      ^If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.
          
          => server.use((req,res,next)=>{});


-------auth (localhost:8080?password=564)

  * In postman we can use URL with pass as we do but Postman have the PARAMETERS
  which we can send so that we don't have to give the passs owrk with the link to access with auth

      Postmaan => Headers =>raw(encoding) =>.json (type u are sending)

   ----Built-in-MiddleWare
    *express.static - gets the folder as it is.. for the static folder , even auth will not stop
    *express.json - helps us to read json body
    *express.urlencoded


-----Third-Party MiddleWare
   helps in performing additional activities like : passing the cookie, passing the raw data, etc....

---MORGAN
   if needed follow docs. Im not practicing it

//----types through which we can request to get the data
now we are learning about 
  req.query - 
  req.body -
  req.params - //product folder is static but :is id dynamic
               //better for dynamic and to send particular link
